                AI4EOSC Templates provides a web form to generate software projects based on
                cookiecuter templates for the AI4EOSC platform. Users fill in the requirements and,
                when submitted, receive a zip file containing a customised AI4EOSC startup software
                project. The AI4EOSC Templates application has a Python backend compliant with the
