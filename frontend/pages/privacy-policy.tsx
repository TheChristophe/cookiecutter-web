            <h2>SERVICE</h2>
            <p>
                Templates Hub provides a Hub to collect software templates based on{' '}
                <a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter">cookiecuters</a> and to
                generate software projects from them. Users can add new templates, search, list
                them, choose a template of their preference, fill out the corresponding web form
                and, when submitted, receive a zip file containing a customized startup software
                project. The Templates Hub service consists of the Python backend compliant with the
                OpenAPI specification and the frontend to provide the web GUI. The template records
                are collected in the github repository and cached in the database local to the
                service.
            </p>
            <p>
                The service is provided by the Computer Centre SCC of the Karlsruhe Institute of
                Technology (KIT).
